### Cracking the Wall of Confinement: Understanding and Analyzing Malicious Domain Take-downs

NDSS 2020

> 待更新

#### 阅读

##### Introduction

- Challenges in domain take-downs - no trival

  - rather opaque and quite complicated

    > It involves several ** steps** (complaint submission, take-down execution, and release, see Section II). It also involves multiple **parties** (authorities, registries, and registrars), and multiple **domain management elements** (DNS, WHOIS, and registry pools). 
    
  - little information available
  
    > little information is available about the taken-down domains, take-down parties, and the operators controlling them. Therefore, this information needs to be collected to make the study possible.
  
  - difficult to evaluating the security and performance 
  
    > evaluating the security and performance of the take-down party requires nontrivial effort as each party manages its own DNS settings.
  
- Our study

  - the **first** systematic study on domain take-down for questions:

    - 多久被拦截？拦截后多久释放？释放多久多久被再次注册？过程中有哪些漏洞？有哪些较好的域名拦截服务

  - 数据收集及反查

    - sinkhole list, blacklist, passive DNS data, whois

    - >More specifically, we manually build a list of sinkhole nameservers and IP addresses by searching various online posts, and reverse WHOIS lookup on known sinkhole regis- trant information, such as contact information, to find hidden sinkholes. Further, our approach leverages PDNS to determine their sinkhole duration and release date, and addresses the challenges introduced by the PDNS data aggregation.

    - 对于delisted take-down domains

      无法从PDNS中查询，通过whois信息识别并获取拦截时段

  - 实验发现

    - 分析60w被拦截的域名，分析其生命周期（6年），平均拦截时长为2年，存在拦截后被重新用于恶意行为
    - some sinkhole nameservers’ domains have expired and been allowed to be repurchased by the public.
    - some take-down parties utilize a Cloud DNS service for sinkholing and leave their NS records outdated after they have stopped using the cloud DNS service. 
    - the erroneous settings of seized domains. Some of these domains quickly expire, well before their expected take-down duration ends. （feat & Early domain deletions）

- Contribution

  - New understanding of domain take-downs
  - Security analysis of take-down parties.

##### Background

- Domain take-down process involves：

  - take-down requester 拦截请求方
  - take-down authority 第三方服务， 常和requester为一方
  - take-down executor 修改Internet name system执行拦截
  - elements of the Internet name system: DNS, whois, registry domain pools

- Opeartional elements

  - Domain sinkholing: 重定向，修改DNS记录

  - Domain delisting: 删除

    > removing it from DNS and responding with nonexistence (i.e., NXDomain) to any DNS queries.
    >
    > Delisting goes a step further by modifying the **WHOIS** https://whois.icann.org/en/about-whois records of the domain and placing a *hold* on the domain, thus stopping it from being released back to registries until it either expires or the hold is removed.

    In the process of domain take-down, registries and registrars may delist a domain by setting its EPP status code to SERVERHOLD and CLIENTHOLD, respectively. 

  - Domain reserved

    Reserved domains are the ones locked by their TLD registry. These domains are not included in the public pool of available domains. 

- Threat Model

  - 识别利用domain take-down过程中的漏洞重新控制被拦截域名的攻击者

  - > This not only renders the domain take-down process less effective but also opens the door for new attack vectors such as the exploitation of outdated sinkhole configuration settings.

##### FINDING TAKEN-DOWN DOMAINS

- Identifying sinkholes operators:   

  - 收集公开的sinkhole feeds，即被沉洞的ip和domain数据，包括take-down notices and reports, domain removal lists, and existing sinkhole lists。然后在被动DNS数据中搜索report的时间段内记录，然后寻找用来实现sinkhole的域名和ip。过程中对sinkholed nameservers/ips进行验证。
  - 通过whois邮件反查获得更多sinkhole nameserver

#### 其他

- Words：opaque, in-depth, delefence
- sinkholes，DNS沉洞/黑洞DNS：DNS给出错误信息从而阻止访问特定域名
- EPP：Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) status codes： indicate if a domain is active or whether it can be transferred, modified, or deleted.
