> Malicious Ground Truth. To get a ground truth of malicious domains, the dominant practice in existing works is to extract it from various public blacklists. Some of the blacklists are only about specific malicious activities, e.g., spams (Spamhaus [15], Yahoo Webspam Database [21]), phishing (PhishTank [125], OpenPhish [13]), while some others are more general and include domains/IPs involved in any kind of malicious activities, e.g., VirusTotal [159], McAfee SiteAdvisor [10], Malware Domains [153] and Malware Domains List [9]. Some of these sources, such as WoT [19], can also blacklist domains that are not, per se, associated with malicious activities. This is the case when the content of such web sites is considered inappropriate with respect to the policies in place for the specific blacklist considered (e.g., pornographic content, violence, racism, copyrighted material, etc.). Another source to build ground truth is proprietary blacklist/whitelists, or proprietary reputation systems deployed by anti-virus security companies (e.g., Symantec), whose availability to the general research community is quite limited.

> Benign Ground Truth. Ground truth of benign domains in the literature is largely drawn from 5 highly ranked popular domains. For example, Alexa top ranked domains [25] are commonly used . Another common practice, at least when building an initial candidate set of benign domains, is based on the top level domains. For example, domains from “gov” and “mil” zones or those belonging to Google and Microsoft (used, e.g., in [174]), are generally considered more trustworthy than those from “com” or “info”. Additionally, some public cyber intelligence tools like McAfee SiteAdvisor [10], Google Safe Browsing [8] or Web Of Trust [19] report not only malicious and suspicious domains, but also benign ones and hence, can be also used to extract benign ground truth.

> 参考二  **HinDom: A Robust Malicious Domain Detection System based on Heterogeneous Information Network with Transductive Classificatio**

> To build the test dataset, we labeled about 1 million doains queried in CERNET2 on 13 April 2018 by referring to various whitelists/blacklists and expertise. For benign information, we regard <font color=#CD6155>domains whose 2LD appear in Alexa Top 1K list  or our local whitelist as benign ones</font>. For malicious domains, we use <font color=#CD6155>multiple sources like *Malwaredomains.com* , *Malwaredomainlist.com* , DGArchive , etc.</font> We also refer to <font color=#CD6155>integrated services like Google Safe Browsing [9] and VirusTotal [34]. </font>Besides, we manually investigate <font color=#CD6155>dubious domains</font> which have both benign and malicious information.





> 参考三  **HinDom: A Robust Malicious Domain Detection System based on Heterogeneous Information Network with Transductive Classificatio**

>  In this work, we <font color=#CD6155>use  VirusTotal (www.virustotal. com)</font>, which, when given a domain, queries it over more than 60 well-known blacklists. We submit each domain in a domain graph to VirusTotal using its public API1, and those listed by at least one of the blacklists form our ground truth of malicious domains.

> We builds benign domain ground truth using Alexa top ranked domains. Specifically, we treat a domain as benign if its top-level domain is one of the Alexa Top 20K domains (http://www.alexa.com).
